# AWS OpenShift Reference Architectures

The reference architectures are provided in three different forms, with increasing security and associated complexity. The source of these reference architecture diagrams can be found [here](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/automation-solutions/blob/main/architectures/aws-cloud-architecture-0.7.drawio)

## Quick Start

As the name suggests, Quick Start provides a simple architecture intended to get up and running quickly with Red Hat OpenShift on AWS (ROSA).

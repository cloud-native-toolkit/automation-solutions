# Reference Architectures

The reference architectures are provided in three different forms, with increasing security and associated complexity. These three forms are:

- **Quick Start** - a simple architecture to quickly get an OpenShift cluster provisioned
- **Standard** - a standard production deployment environment with typical security protections, private endpoints, VPN server, key management encryption, etc
- **Production** - a more advanced deployment that employs network isolation to securely route traffic between the different layers.

For each of these reference architecture forns, we have provided a detailed reference architecture on the different hyperscalers.

# automation-solutions
A collection of Bills of Materials (BOMs) that address solution/use-case scenarios.  

A Solution is a descriptor that contains metadata and the list of BOMs that will be used to generate terraform for a specific Solution or Use Case.


Repo contents:
- `boms` directory contains a collection of bills of materials, and their corresponding files (subdir)
- `common-files` directory that contains common files that will be included when we generate a solution
- `schema` - sample schema/CRD structure for a solution
- `solutions` - Solution instances

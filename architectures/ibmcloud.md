# IBM Cloud OpenShift Reference Architectures

The reference architectures are provided in three different forms, with increasing security and associated complexity.

## Quick Start

As the name suggests, Quick Start provides a simple architecture intended to get up and running quickly with OpenShift on IBM Cloud.

## Standard

The Standard architecture provides a secure OpenShift architecture contained within a single VPC network. It is sufficient for many production and development environments.

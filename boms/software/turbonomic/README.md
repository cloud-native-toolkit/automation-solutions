# Turbonomic - Bill of Materials

This folder contains the Bill of Materials (*BOMs*) for the Turbonomic Automation for AWS, Azure and IBM Cloud multi cloud deployments.

Below you can see how Turbonomic can help your organisation introspect the costs and resources of your complex cloud enviroments.

## Overview

BOMs are the raw ingredients for building automation for complex cloud installations. They are described in `YAML` and  enables automation to be created to deploy infrastructure and software into cloud environments.


GitOps within an AWS ROSA, Azure ARO, IBM Cloud ROKS cluster.

## Bill of Materials

List of BOMs for Turbonomic, there is a generic one for on premise. You will need to make sure the Storage classes are defined. The others have specific setting to enable install into the cloud platform with the correctly specified storage classes.

- [Turbonomics for Generic Install](./400-turbo-bom.yaml)
- [Turbonomics for AWS](./400-turbo-bom.yaml)
- [Turbonomics for Azure](./400-turbo-bom.yaml)
- [Turbonomics for IBM Cloud](./400-turbo-bom.yaml)

### Validated Open-Source Release

Before you attempt to generate and modify your BOM content,  if you want a tested and validated version you can go directly to the Open-Source release of the generated content. 
- [Turbonomic for AWS, Azure and IBM Cloud](https://github.com/IBM/automation-turbonomic) 

Follow the installation instructions from the above link to deploy using a package version of the **Terraform** automation.

If you want to download the latest version from the *Solution Builder* use the [Ascent](https://ascent.openfn.co) tool and  login with your IBM ID. Navigate to Solution view and click *Download* on the *Turbonomic for AWS, Azure and IBM Cloud* tile. 

## Generating Automation

If you want to get the latest upstream content you can generate the latest automation using the steps below:

### Install IasCable

First you will need to install the latest version of [iascable](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/iascable/blob/main/README.md) into your `/usr/local/bin` folder, you can do this by running the following cli command. This tools converts BOMs into automation.

```shell
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloud-native-toolkit/iascable/main/install.sh | sh
```
### Generate Command

To generate from a BOM , clone this repository onto your machines or trusted environment. You will create and `automation` folder to store the output of the generation. Use the the following commands.

> We assuming you have installed [brew]() for MacOS at this point 

Run the following commands to turn the BOM into Automation. install a simple `tree` tool and create your output directory.

```shell
brew install tree
mkdir ~/automation
```

Pick the BOM you want to generate for the platform you are targeting.
```
cd boms/software/turbonomic
iascable build -i ./400-400-turbo-bom.yaml -o ~/automation

    Name: 400-gitops-ocp-turbonomic
    Loading catalog from url: https://modules.cloudnativetoolkit.dev/index.yaml
    Writing output to: ~/automation
```

You can see the output of the generation 

```bash
tree ~/automation/
```

You will see this generated content. You can use the [README.md](./files/README.md) in the `files` folder understand how to perform the specific installation.

```bash
